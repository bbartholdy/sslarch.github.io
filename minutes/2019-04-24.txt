Protocol of the Roundtable Discussion on Scientific Scripting Languages in Archaeology
2019-04-24, 16:00-18:00


Introductory Statements

Martin Hinz: Stay DRY! Why scientific scripting speeds up research, fosters more interesting science and helps save taxpayers money.

Lizzy Scholtus: Scripting languages community: an important tool to develop the existence of these techniques

Joe Roe: The boundary between "scientific programming" and "software development"

Iza Romanowska: Who are Research Software Engineers and why should we care?

Clemens Schmid: (Don't Fear) The Reaper. A SIG as long term software maintenance network?


Aims and objectives 
    • develop guide lines / code of conduct for everyone: ask for code if reviewing or reject review, license code, readme files, cite packages, DOI code
    • lobby for institutional support to make data scientists as important and recognized as a ceramic specialist , make code equal to publication (which means it will need a review system) – Research Software Engineers are not technicians 
    • improve other people’s code and technology literacy (build modules for software carpentry? Give workshops? Make online courses available / visible to the archaeological community? searchable index for software / code etc used by archaeologists?) 
    • focus on teaching – how to integrate coding into the basic archaeological curriculum
    • lobby for diversity (women, POC etc can code just as well)
    • develop agenda and research questions that can be answered with digital tools / coding
    • lobby for transparency and reproducibility for good scientific and archaeological research
Long term goals
    • Develop structures similar to rOpenSci project (offer code review if you want your code reviewed, maintain software)
    • Journal for archaeological software
    • Salvage old code or at least put together a list of code that be good to save

Infrastructure
    • We will bid for a CAA SIG next year in Oxford
        ◦ bid document needs to be submitted 2months before next AGM (no special guidelines)
        ◦ members don’t need to stay in the CAA 
        ◦ we can start working right now (“in preperation for the CAA SIG to be created”)
    • Website (sslarch.github.io) (maintained by Joe and Iza) shall include
            ▪ code of conduct, pointers to teaching / guide lines already existing 
            ▪ list of names and list of software (and software to be salvaged) (tags should be standardized)
            ▪ events
            ▪ zotero / bibliography
    • Github
        ◦ create an issue to decide on name of SIG: Reproducible research in arch? Scientific scripting languages in arch? R in the title? What about SQL/ GIS … -stuff?
    • Mailing list / google group
        ◦ Already in place: sig.sci.script.arch@gmail.com 
Long term ideas:
    • Create task groups for different topics and list people with skills to find each other
    • EU Cost funding for networking
